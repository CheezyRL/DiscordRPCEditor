# DiscordRPCEditor

This program was made so you can easily change/set rich presence for your Discord profile. To create a rich presence, you can either use the default application already set up, or you can create your own. If you are going to compile this application, build DiscordRPCClient (Discord RPC Editor) first and then replace the existing Discord RPC Editor in Discord RPC Client to create an installer. You could also use Discord RPC Editor if you wanted to install it anywhere, as long as the two dependencies stay with it.

# Creating Discord Applications for Rich Presence

  - Go to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications), sign in (if not already) and create a new application
  - Copy the Client ID, you're going to need that for later
  - Click on Rich Presence on the left column, then under Art Assets upload some images to use
  - Name the images now, because you can't change them after you upload unless if you re-upload them
  - Keep note on what you named the images, because those names are what you're going to be using in the Large Image Key and Small Image Key text boxes
  
# Using your Discord Application

  - Open the application, then click on **Use custom rich presence...**
  - Paste the Client ID you copied from earlier into the box, then click on Check to validate the ID and save it
  - Close out of the Client ID box and then fill out all of the details you want for your custom rich presence
  - Click on **Restart Rich Presence** to apply your Client ID, and to activate Rich Presence.
  
  That's it! You should now see your custom rich presence displayed on your Discord profile.
